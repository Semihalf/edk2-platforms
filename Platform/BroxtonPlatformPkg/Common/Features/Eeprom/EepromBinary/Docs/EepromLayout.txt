- The first 4KB of the EEPROM data MUST be accessible from I2C bus
  gPlatformModuleTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEepromBus, address
  gPlatformModuleTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEepromAddress and MUST contain, at a minimum, the
  EEPROM Header structure, Board Info structure and EEPROM Map structure in their entirety.

- These structures must be contiguous in the EEPROM part. That is one structure ends and
  the next starts on the next paragraph aligned byte.

- They must be paragraph aligned.

- Unused space between structures will be zero filled.

- They must start with the same 16 byte header structure so unknown structures can still
  get "walked". (See Generic header.)

- The EEPROM header structure must be first, the EepromMap is second, the BoardInfo is third,
  the Signature structure must be last (if it exists), and the others may be in any order.

- The EEPROM Map records must start at offset 0x00000000 and proceed in numeric order. In
  other words, the records should describe the EEPROM data layout from beginning to end, in
  order, without gaps.

- Each EEPROM has it's own EEPROM map. The header will tell what I2C bus this EEPROM is on
  and how many bytes are in each block. The map record will tell where each block is on the
  I2C bus and where it goes in the EEPROM binary. This allows the binary to self-describe
  the EEPROM layout scheme without the code requiring any knowledge of the EEPROM devices.

- There may be multiple EEPROM devices on multiple buses. The master EEPROM map describes
  the platform. Slave EEPROM maps would typically describe add-on cards. It is assumed that
  if the first EEPROM map record block is invalid, then that entire EEPROM map is invalid.
  In other words, if you can't find the $Eeprom$.Signature at offset 0x00, then that map is
  invalid. Each map creates it's own image and is validated separately from each other. The
  master image should only contain possible slave EEPROM maps with a single record that
  points to the first 4KB for that possible slave image. The slave image will contain a full
  EEPROM map to describe that EEPROM. It has yet to be determined how slave images are
  integrated into the master image data.
  [***Slave image support has not been coded yet.***]

- If the structure header size or layout changes, then the structure VerMajor must be reved
  and the VerMinor reset to 0x0000.

- If the structure reserved bytes are used, then the structure VerMinor must be reved and
  the VerMajor remains the same.

- CRC32 is calculated by pre-filling in the CRC32 with 0x00. It includes all of the
  structures in their entirety, including the Signature structure (if it exists) up to the
  $PromSig.EepromSig, but not including the $PromSig.EepromSig element, as well as any blank
  space between structures.

- If a hash is used, the CRC32 must already be filled out before calculating. Everything up
  to, but not including, the $PromSig.EepromSig is included in the hash. The hash is then
  added to $PromSig.EepromSig. If a signed hash is indicated, then it is added after the
  hash data.

- The header "Length" field will contain the actual structure size and not account for any
  unused space between structures.

- GPIO data records are applied in order. IE - Start at the beginning and apply the records
  in order.
  WARNING: Care must be exercised to ensure that non-whitelisted data is not programmed.

- If characters in a Signature[8] or a Label[16] don't fill the entire allocated length,
  append string with $ as a sentinel value. IE - Signature[8] : "$uCode" shall be "$uCode$"

- If there is a valid binary in both the FV and EEPROM, BIOS will use the following rules to determine
  which one to load into memory and use:
  - It is assumed that the FV and EEPROM binaries have both passed sanity checks.
    - CRC32 passes
    - Hash and signed hash passes if present
  - If the following fields are not equal, then the FV is assumed to have priority:
    - $BrdInfo.ManuName
    - $BrdInfo.BrdName
    - $BrdInfo.BoardId
    - $BrdInfo.FabId
    - $BrdInfo.EcId
    - $BrdInfo.BoardType
  - If the $BrdInfo test passes, then priority is given to the image with the greater $Eeprom$.Version.
  - If the $BrdInfo test passes and $Eeprom$.Version are equal, then use the FV due to speed concerns.

- Due to the size of OpenSSL, it is unavailable in PEI for verifying the hash and/or signature in
  $PromSig. As such, the $PromSig data, if present, is stored in a NvStorage variable for use in PEI.
  It will be checked and if needed, updated each boot in DXE. If it changes, then BIOS will reboot to
  ensure that the PEI integrity check passes.
