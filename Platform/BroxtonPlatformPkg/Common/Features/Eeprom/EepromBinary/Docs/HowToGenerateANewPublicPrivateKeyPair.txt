How to generate a new public-private key pair:
1. Ensure you have python 2.7 installed on your host system.
2. Ensure you have copied OpenSsl.exe into the EepromBinary\Utilities\OpenSsl directory.
3. Starting in the root EEPROM directory, use the following command:
   Python.exe EepromBinary\Utilities\CreateKeyPair.py EepromBinary\Utilities\OpenSsl\openssl.exe EepromBinary\ProjectName\RSA-keys
   This will generate 3 files in the RSA-keys directory, INCLUDING THE PRIVATE KEY!
